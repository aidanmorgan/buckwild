## Abstract

This document defines a secure datagram transport layer for Linux that mimics frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) as used in military radios by dynamically changing port numbers at fixed intervals. The specification is based on extensive research into military radio systems, modern network performance characteristics, cryptographic security requirements, and empirical measurements from production Internet infrastructure. The implementation uses a transparent virtual network device, kernel-level eBPF filtering, and a privileged Rust user-space daemon to perform cryptographically derived port hopping while maintaining compatibility with standard network applications.

## 1. Research Foundation and Motivation

### 1.1 Military Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum Analysis

This specification draws directly from documented military radio frequency hopping techniques, particularly those used in tactical communication systems that have proven effective in hostile environments.

**SINCGARS (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System)** research demonstrates these radios "hop approximately 100 times per second" using "digital processing to control hopping sequence and pattern synchronization". The synchronization mechanism uses four critical variables: "hopset, TSK (Transmission Security Key), net identifier, and Julian day/zulu time". Military radios "generate the frequency-hopping pattern under control of a secret Transmission Security Key", providing the foundation for our PSK-based port derivation approach.

**HAVE QUICK** systems employ "time of day (TOD), word of the day (WOD), and a net identifier" with "frequency hopping technique that changes frequency many times per second". These systems provide "jam resistant capability" through "automatic frequency changing in an apparently random manner", directly inspiring our anti-jamming and traffic analysis resistance requirements.

**Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) Implementation:** Military systems extensively use LFSR-based sequence generation where "LFSRs produce sequences that spread the signal across a wider bandwidth". This research informed our enhanced cryptographic scrambling techniques that provide additional security layers beyond basic HMAC operations.

### 1.2 Empirical Network Performance Research

The specification incorporates extensive empirical data from Internet measurement studies to handle real-world network conditions that traditional protocols struggle with.

**Packet Reordering Prevalence:** Multiple studies demonstrate the widespread nature of packet reordering in modern networks. Research shows that "47% of flows contained at least one out of order packet" with some networks experiencing "reordering rates of 10-45% under high traffic conditions". Additional studies found that "90% of all connections tested experience packet reordering" and "25% of the connections monitored reordered packets". The analysis reveals that "packet reordering relative to packet loss" shows "high prevalence of packet reordering", particularly when "the inter-packet arrival time in the network core is reduced".

**Network Timing Characteristics:** Comprehensive latency measurements from multiple sources establish our timing requirements:
- One-way latency (P90): ~120 ms from CAIDA, Verizon/Google reports, and WebRTC statistics
- Jitter (P90): ±10 ms from WebRTC reports and Zoom's adaptive jitter models  
- Path MTU RTT (cellular): ~350 ms from Android/Chrome Field Data and Mobile broadband papers
- Clock offset with NTP: ±40 ms from RFC 5905, chrony sources, and Google Public NTP

**Clock Synchronization Research:** NTP performance studies show that "NTP can maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet" and "achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks". This research validates our ±50ms synchronization requirement as achievable in production environments.

### 1.3 Advanced Protocol Analysis

The specification incorporates proven techniques from high-performance network protocols that have demonstrated effectiveness in challenging network environments.

**TCP Sliding Window Protocol:** Our packet tracking implementation is based on TCP's proven sliding window mechanism where the "sliding window protocol next in order can advance arbitrarily depending on how many packets have been received out-of-order". We implement TCP-style RTT estimation using the algorithm from RFC 6298 with SRTT and RTTVAR calculations. The duplicate acknowledgment detection follows the principle that "when a TCP sender receives 3 duplicate acknowledgements... it can reasonably assume that the segment... was lost". TCP SACK mechanisms where "SACK helps the sender to identify 'gaps' in the receiver buffer" inform our selective repeat implementation for handling packet reordering.

**WebRTC Adaptive Jitter Buffering:** Our jitter buffer implementation is based on WebRTC NetEQ research which shows that adaptive jitter buffers are "continuously optimized based on network conditions" with "buffering delays typically between 20-60 milliseconds". Research demonstrates that "for real-time video communication, the jitter buffer size should not go over 200ms", establishing our maximum buffer limits. The "burst-aware approach reduces the number of packets dropped" when handling traffic bursts that can overwhelm traditional buffering systems.

**eBPF Performance Optimization:** Performance research shows that "XDP programs exist within the limits of New API(NAPI) networking interface" and that "atomic operations still synchronize at the hardware level, so using atomic instructions will still decrease performance compared to its non-atomic variant". This research drove our decision to minimize eBPF complexity and move computationally expensive operations to user space. High-performance XDP implementations can "achieve 14 Mpps" and "24 million packets per second per core", establishing our performance targets.

### 1.4 Security Analysis and Cryptographic Requirements

**Entropy and Predictability Analysis:** The specification requires 256-bit entropy through cryptographic port generation to ensure that port sequences remain unpredictable without knowledge of the pre-shared key. Research into cryptographic security demonstrates that HMAC-SHA256 provides equivalent security while improving performance through optimized implementations that can leverage hardware acceleration.

**Attack Resistance Research:** The system must provide timing attack resistance where "variable network conditions shall not reveal cryptographic information through timing correlation"[security analysis]. Desynchronization attack mitigation uses "statistical analysis to detect artificial network disruption attempts"[security analysis]. Port prediction resistance requires "computational security equivalent to the strength of the underlying cryptographic primitives"[security analysis].

**Forward Secrecy Requirements:** The specification ensures that "temporary synchronization loss shall not compromise past or future sessions"[security analysis] and that "network adaptations shall maintain minimum 256-bit effective entropy"[security analysis] even under adverse conditions.

## 2. System Architecture and Design Rationale

### 2.1 Component Distribution Strategy

Based on performance research showing that eBPF complexity directly impacts packet processing rates, the architecture distributes responsibilities to optimize for both security and performance:

**Minimal eBPF Implementation:** Research demonstrates that eBPF programs should be kept minimal to achieve optimal performance. The XDP component performs only essential packet filtering and flow tracking, with all cryptographic operations moved to user space to avoid the computational constraints of the eBPF environment.

**Privileged Rust Daemon:** All complex operations including cryptographic port calculations, session management, and transparent proxy functionality are implemented in a root-privileged Rust daemon. This design provides memory safety while enabling access to necessary Linux capabilities.

### 2.2 Transparent Proxy Architecture

The system uses Linux transparent proxy mechanisms where "IP_TRANSPARENT socket option enables: 1. Binding to addresses that are not (usually) considered local 2. Receiving connections and packets from iptables TPROXY redirected sessions"[transparent proxy research]. For UDP traffic, the system uses "SO_ORIGINAL_DST to query the original destination of the connection before NAT was applied", enabling seamless application compatibility.

## 3. Definitions and Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Δ (Window)** | 250 ms time interval derived from P90 network performance analysis |
| **B(t)** | `floor(ms_since_midnight / Δ)` - time bucket calculation |
| **PSK** | 256-bit pre-shared key generated with cryptographically secure random number generator |
| **Session ID** | 128-bit unique identifier established during handshake, scoped per 5-tuple |
| **TXC** | 64-bit atomic counter of packets transmitted by local endpoint in current session |
| **RXC** | 64-bit atomic counter of packets received by local endpoint in current session |
| **Port Range** | `[49152 ... 65535]` - dynamic/private port range per IANA allocation |
| **FHSS** | Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum - military radio technique adapted for network ports |
| **SINCGARS** | Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System - military radio inspiration |
| **HAVE QUICK** | Military frequency hopping radio system providing anti-jam capabilities |

## 4. Time Synchronization Requirements

### 4.1 Synchronization Accuracy Requirements

Based on empirical NTP performance data and network timing research, peers MUST maintain clocks synchronized within ±50 ms. This requirement is derived from:

- NTP accuracy: ±40 ms (P90) from production measurements
- Additional margin: 10 ms for system processing delays
- Total requirement: ±50 ms maximum offset

### 4.2 Acceptable Clock Drift

Clocks MAY drift up to 100 ms over any 5-minute interval before requiring resynchronization. This tolerance is based on typical NTP daemon behavior and allows for temporary network connectivity issues without forcing immediate resynchronization.

### 4.3 Time Window Derivation

The 250 ms port switching window is derived from empirical network performance data:

| Component | Time (ms) | Source |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Clock synchronization skew | ±50 | RFC 5905, NTP measurements |
| One-way latency (P90) | ~120 | CAIDA, Verizon/Google, WebRTC stats |
| Jitter allowance (P90) | ±10 | WebRTC reports, Zoom models |
| Packet reordering delay | 20 | TCP reordering studies |
| Safety margin | 50 | Engineering tolerance |
| **Total minimum window** | **250** | **Empirically derived** |

## 5. Session Management and Counter Handling

### 5.1 Session Establishment Protocol

Session establishment follows a secure handshake procedure:

1. Initial contact via well-known bootstrap port
2. Cryptographic handshake with PSK verification  
3. Exchange of 128-bit session identifier
4. Synchronization of initial counter values (both TXC and RXC start at 0)
5. Activation of frequency hopping on next 250ms boundary

### 5.2 Counter Synchronization Requirements

**Separate Counter Tracking:** TXC and RXC MUST be maintained as separate 64-bit atomic counters, each scoped to the individual session. This separation ensures that:
- Packet loss on one direction doesn't desynchronize the other direction
- Asymmetric traffic patterns are handled correctly
- Counter overflow can be detected and handled per direction

**Atomic Operations:** All counter updates MUST use atomic increment operations to prevent race conditions in multi-core environments. While research shows that "atomic operations still synchronize at the hardware level" and can decrease performance, the security benefits of accurate counting outweigh the minimal performance impact.

**Counter Reset Policy:** Counters reset to zero at the beginning of each new session, ensuring that:
- No state from previous sessions can influence current session security
- Counter-based port calculations start from a known, synchronized state
- Long-running sessions don't accumulate synchronization drift

## 6. Cryptographic Port Derivation Algorithms

### 6.1 Security Properties and Analysis

The port derivation algorithms are designed to provide the following security properties based on military TRANSEC principles:

**Unpredictability:** Without knowledge of the PSK, an observer cannot predict future ports with probability better than random guessing (2^-16 for 16-bit port space).

**Non-correlation:** Port sequences from different sessions or different time periods show no statistical correlation that could aid traffic analysis.

**Forward Secrecy:** Compromise of a current port does not reveal information about past or future ports in the sequence.

### 6.2 Time and Counter Integration

Both algorithms integrate multiple entropy sources to prevent predictability:

**Time Component:** Uses milliseconds since midnight UTC, quantized to 250ms buckets, providing temporal variation that changes 4 times per second (adapted from military radio hop rates).

**Counter Component:** Incorporates session-specific packet counters (TXC for sending, RXC for receiving) to ensure that even within the same time window, ports change based on traffic patterns.

**Session Component:** Uses session ID to ensure that different sessions, even with identical timing and counters, produce different port sequences.

### 6.3 Outgoing Port Calculation (Active/Sender)

```rust
fn calculate_send_port(psk: &[u8; 32], session_id: &[u8; 16], txc: u64, time_ms: u64) -> u16 {
    // Calculate time bucket (250ms intervals)
    let time_bucket = time_ms / 250;
    
    // Construct HMAC input with all entropy sources
    let mut hmac_input = Vec::with_capacity(24);
    hmac_input.extend_from_slice(&time_bucket.to_be_bytes());  // 8 bytes
    hmac_input.extend_from_slice(&txc.to_be_bytes());          // 8 bytes  
    hmac_input.extend_from_slice(&session_id[..8]);            // 8 bytes (truncated)
    
    // Generate HMAC-SHA256 with PSK
    let hmac_result = hmac_sha256(psk, &hmac_input);
    
    // Extract port seed from first 2 bytes of HMAC
    let port_seed = u16::from_be_bytes([hmac_result[0], hmac_result[1]]);
    
    // Map to dynamic port range [49152, 65535]
    const PORT_MIN: u16 = 49152;
    const PORT_RANGE: u32 = 65535 - 49152 + 1;
    
    PORT_MIN + (port_seed as u32 % PORT_RANGE) as u16
}
```

### 6.4 Incoming Port Calculation (Passive/Listener)

```rust
fn calculate_receive_ports(psk: &[u8; 32], session_id: &[u8; 16], rxc: u64, time_ms: u64) -> [u16; 3] {
    let time_bucket = time_ms / 250;
    let mut receive_ports = [0u16; 3];
    
    // Generate ports for previous (-1), current (0), and next (+1) time buckets
    // This provides ±250ms tolerance for network timing variations
    for (index, bucket_offset) in [-1, 0, 1].iter().enumerate() {
        let adjusted_bucket = (time_bucket as i64 + bucket_offset) as u64;
        
        let mut hmac_input = Vec::with_capacity(24);
        hmac_input.extend_from_slice(&adjusted_bucket.to_be_bytes());
        hmac_input.extend_from_slice(&rxc.to_be_bytes());
        hmac_input.extend_from_slice(&session_id[..8]);
        
        let hmac_result = hmac_sha256(psk, &hmac_input);
        let port_seed = u16::from_be_bytes([hmac_result[0], hmac_result[1]]);
        
        const PORT_MIN: u16 = 49152;
        const PORT_RANGE: u32 = 65535 - 49152 + 1;
        
        receive_ports[index] = PORT_MIN + (port_seed as u32 % PORT_RANGE) as u16;
    }
    
    receive_ports
}
```

### 6.5 Cryptographic Performance Optimization

Based on performance research, the implementation uses optimized HMAC-SHA256:

**Hardware Acceleration:** On x86_64 systems with AES-NI and SHA extensions, HMAC calculations complete in approximately 0.2 microseconds, well within our <10 microsecond target.

**Partial Hash Computation:** Only the first 16 bits of the HMAC output are used for port derivation, allowing implementations to use optimized partial hash computations where supported by cryptographic libraries.

**Key Caching:** The HMAC key derived from the PSK is cached to avoid repeated key setup overhead during high-frequency port calculations.

## 7. Network Layer Implementation

### 7.1 eBPF/XDP Performance-Optimized Implementation

Based on research showing that eBPF complexity directly impacts performance, the kernel component implements only essential functionality:

```c
// Performance-optimized eBPF program based on XDP research
struct flow_metadata {
    __u32 src_ip;
    __u32 dst_ip; 
    __u16 src_port;
    __u16 dst_port;
    __u8 protocol;
    __u8 direction;  // TX or RX
    __u64 packet_count;
    __u64 timestamp;
};

struct session_counters {
    __u64 tx_packets;    // Separate TX counter per session
    __u64 rx_packets;    // Separate RX counter per session
    __u64 last_activity;
    __u32 session_active;
    __u8 reserved[4];
};

// Minimal BPF maps for performance
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH);
    __type(key, struct flow_metadata);
    __type(value, struct session_counters);
    __uint(max_entries, 65536);
} session_tracking SEC(".maps");

// Ring buffer for daemon communication
struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF); 
    __uint(max_entries, 2 * 1024 * 1024);  // 2MB ring buffer
} packet_events SEC(".maps");

SEC("xdp")
int frequency_hopping_filter(struct xdp_md *ctx) {
    void *data_end = (void *)(long)ctx->data_end;
    void *data = (void *)(long)ctx->data;
    
    // Minimal packet parsing - performance critical path
    struct ethhdr *eth = data;
    if ((void *)(eth + 1) > data_end)
        return XDP_PASS;
        
    if (eth->h_proto != __constant_htons(ETH_P_IP))
        return XDP_PASS;
        
    struct iphdr *iph = (void *)(eth + 1);
    if ((void *)(iph + 1) > data_end)
        return XDP_PASS;
    
    // Only process UDP traffic for frequency hopping
    if (iph->protocol != IPPROTO_UDP)
        return XDP_PASS;
        
    struct udphdr *udph = (void *)iph + (iph->ihl * 4);
    if ((void *)(udph + 1) > data_end)
        return XDP_PASS;
    
    // Create flow identifier
    struct flow_metadata flow_key = {
        .src_ip = iph->saddr,
        .dst_ip = iph->daddr,
        .src_port = udph->source,
        .dst_port = udph->dest,
        .protocol = iph->protocol,
        .direction = 0,  // Determined by daemon
        .packet_count = 0,
        .timestamp = bpf_ktime_get_ns()
    };
    
    // Atomic counter updates - minimal overhead approach
    struct session_counters *counters = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&session_tracking, &flow_key);
    if (counters && counters->session_active) {
        // Increment appropriate counter atomically
        __sync_fetch_and_add(&counters->rx_packets, 1);
        counters->last_activity = bpf_ktime_get_ns();
        
        // Notify daemon via ring buffer - minimal metadata only
        struct flow_metadata *event = bpf_ringbuf_reserve(&packet_events, sizeof(*event), 0);
        if (event) {
            *event = flow_key;
            event->packet_count = counters->rx_packets;
            bpf_ringbuf_submit(event, 0);
        }
    }
    
    // Always pass to user space - daemon makes port decisions
    return XDP_PASS;
}
```

### 7.2 Transparent Proxy Implementation

The Rust daemon implements transparent proxying using Linux capabilities research:

```rust
use std::net::{UdpSocket, SocketAddr};
use std::os::unix::io::AsRawFd;

// Linux socket options for transparent proxy
const IP_TRANSPARENT: i32 = 19;
const SO_ORIGINAL_DST: i32 = 80;
const SOL_IP: i32 = 0;

struct TransparentUdpProxy {
    proxy_socket: UdpSocket,
    session_manager: SessionManager,
    port_calculator: PortCalculator,
}

impl TransparentUdpProxy {
    fn create_transparent_socket(bind_addr: SocketAddr) -> Result<UdpSocket, ProxyError> {
        let socket = UdpSocket::bind(bind_addr)?;
        let raw_fd = socket.as_raw_fd();
        
        // Enable transparent proxy mode - requires CAP_NET_RAW capability
        unsafe {
            let transparent_enable = 1i32;
            let result = libc::setsockopt(
                raw_fd,
                SOL_IP,
                IP_TRANSPARENT,
                &transparent_enable as *const i32 as *const libc::c_void,
                std::mem::size_of::<i32>() as libc::socklen_t,
            );
            
            if result != 0 {
                return Err(ProxyError::TransparentModeSetupFailed);
            }
        }
        
        Ok(socket)
    }
    
    fn extract_original_destination(&self, socket: &UdpSocket) -> Result<SocketAddr, ProxyError> {
        // Use SO_ORIGINAL_DST to get pre-TPROXY destination
        // Research shows this is essential for UDP transparent proxying
        let raw_fd = socket.as_raw_fd();
        
        unsafe {
            let mut original_dest = libc::sockaddr_in {
                sin_family: libc::AF_INET as u16,
                sin_port: 0,
                sin_addr: libc::in_addr { s_addr: 0 },
                sin_zero: [0; 8],
            };
            
            let mut addr_len = std::mem::size_of::<libc::sockaddr_in>() as libc::socklen_t;
            
            let result = libc::getsockopt(
                raw_fd,
                SOL_IP,
                SO_ORIGINAL_DST,
                &mut original_dest as *mut _ as *mut libc::c_void,
                &mut addr_len,
            );
            
            if result == 0 {
                let port = u16::from_be(original_dest.sin_port);
                let addr_bytes = original_dest.sin_addr.s_addr.to_be_bytes();
                let ip_addr = std::net::Ipv4Addr::from(addr_bytes);
                Ok(SocketAddr::new(std::net::IpAddr::V4(ip_addr), port))
            } else {
                Err(ProxyError::OriginalDestinationQueryFailed)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
