# Overview

This document defines the complete specification for connection establishment, port hopping synchronization, and recovery mechanisms in the frequency hopping network system. The protocol ensures reliable communication while maintaining synchronized port transitions between endpoints using only pre-shared keys and time-based synchronization.

## Design Goals

The protocol is designed with the following key objectives:

### Security and Privacy
- **Pre-shared Key Security**: All communications are secured using pre-shared keys without requiring additional key exchange protocols
- **Port Hopping Obfuscation**: Frequent port transitions make traffic analysis and connection tracking difficult
- **Anti-Replay Protection**: Comprehensive timestamp and sequence number validation prevents replay attacks
- **Zero-Knowledge Negotiation**: Sequence number negotiation without revealing sensitive information

### Reliability and Robustness
- **Comprehensive Recovery Mechanisms**: Multiple recovery strategies handle various failure scenarios including time desynchronization, sequence number conflicts, and network partitions
- **Adaptive Flow Control**: Dynamic window management optimizes throughput while preventing congestion
- **Fragmentation Support**: Large packets are fragmented and reassembled reliably
- **Timeout and Retry Logic**: Robust timeout handling with exponential backoff and maximum retry limits

### Performance and Efficiency
- **Adaptive Delay Tuning**: Dynamic adjustment of transmission delays based on network conditions
- **Congestion Control**: TCP-compatible congestion control algorithms ensure fair network utilization
- **Selective Acknowledgment**: Efficient acknowledgment of out-of-order packets
- **Optimized Packet Formats**: Compact packet headers minimize overhead

### Synchronization and Coordination
- **Time Synchronization**: Precise time coordination between endpoints enables reliable port hopping
- **Multiple Connection Support**: Collision avoidance mechanisms allow multiple parallel connections
- **Port Transition Coordination**: Synchronized port changes maintain connectivity during hops
- **Emergency Recovery**: Fail-safe mechanisms restore connectivity when normal operations fail

## Protocol Architecture

The protocol operates through several integrated subsystems:

1. **Connection Management**: Handles connection establishment, maintenance, and teardown
2. **Port Hopping Engine**: Manages synchronized port transitions using time-based calculations
3. **Cryptographic Layer**: Provides authentication, integrity, and key derivation services
4. **Flow Control System**: Manages data transmission rates and buffer utilization
5. **Recovery Framework**: Detects and recovers from various failure conditions
6. **Fragmentation Engine**: Handles packet fragmentation and reassembly
7. **Time Synchronization**: Maintains synchronized time references between endpoints

## Key Features

- **Stateful Connection Tracking**: Comprehensive state machine manages connection lifecycle
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Network conditions automatically adjust protocol parameters
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error codes and recovery procedures
- **Security by Design**: All operations assume hostile network environments
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple concurrent connections per endpoint
- **Backward Compatibility**: Versioned packet formats allow protocol evolution
