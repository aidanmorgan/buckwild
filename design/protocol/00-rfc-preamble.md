# RFC: Connection Management and Synchronization Protocol for Frequency Hopping Networks


#DO NOT USE THIS PROTOCOL IN THE REAL WORLD, IT IS PURELY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES#

## Abstract

This document defines a complete specification for connection establishment, port hopping synchronization, and recovery mechanisms in frequency hopping network systems. The protocol ensures reliable communication while maintaining synchronized port transitions between endpoints using only pre-shared keys and time-based synchronization. The specification includes comprehensive mechanisms for congestion control, flow control, fragmentation, cryptographic operations, and robust recovery procedures to handle various failure scenarios.
